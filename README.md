## ⚙️ Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x installed on your system
- 📦 `psutil` module installed for CPU monitoring

## 📥 Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu-usage-monitor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpu-usage-monitor
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

## 📝 Usage Instructions
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cpu_monitor.py
   ```
2. The script will start monitoring CPU usage in real-time.
3. If CPU usage exceeds the threshold (default: 80%), an alert message will be displayed.
4. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring.

## 🔧 Configuration
- Modify the `CPU_USAGE_THRESHOLD` variable in the script to set a custom alert level.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Details
- This project can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to monitor CPU usage during automated testing or deployments.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
- Ensure the script runs with minimal privileges to avoid unnecessary system access.
- Do not modify system files or execute privileged commands without proper authorization.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting
- If `psutil` is not installed, run:
  ```bash
  pip install psutil
  ```
- Ensure Python is properly installed and added to the system PATH.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository and submit a pull request with improvements.
